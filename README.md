**Godot Lua module**
Currently WIP

To compile first clone the current stable tagged version of the [godot source](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/tree/3.2.3-stable).
Clone this repo into the modules folder in the godot source.
Go into the folder for this repo and the lua source folder.
Run `make (linux|windows|macos) test`
Than follow the instructions to build the godot source code on their [website](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/development/compiling/compiling_for_linuxbsd.html#doc-compiling-for-linuxbsd).
